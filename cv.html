    <span class="subsectionTitle">wagely.com</span>
    <p>
      Developed payroll application to allow small businesses to pay employees, deduct taxes from paychecks, e-File quarterly withholding returns with federal/state.
      The application front-end was developed in Ruby on Rails, with a Java backend for processing e-File tax transactions with state/federal governments. Developed
      a full test suite of unit and functional tests in RSpec to ensure application works per specifications.
    </p>
   </div>
   <div class="subsection">
    <span class="subsectionTitle">Find My Train</span>
    <p>
    Developed iOS and Android applications to allow Phoenix light rail users to locate nearest station and see next train arrival time. The application also allows
    users to view a list and map of stations, and view schedule times for all stops for the current day. This application was started at Phoenix Startup
    Weekend in 2012, and took second place. The team then participated in ASU Rapid Startup School and did many customer development interviews with light
    rail riders in order to determine the marketability and optimal set of features for the application.
   </div>
   <div class="subsection">
    <span class="subsectionTitle">ASU Directory</span>
    <br/>
    Arizona State University
    <p/>
    Redesigned backend systems to bring together student/faculty/staff data from various enterprise systems, including Peoplesoft and legacy data sources.
    Created a high performance synchronization process to provide hourly updates to data, replacing the previous system which ran once a day. Added an Apache Solr Cloud
    environment with an index of data for easier searching from user-facing applications.

   <div class="subsection">
    <span class="subsectionTitle">Course Enrollment Manager</span>
    <br/>
    Arizona State University/IDEAL
    <p/>
    Course Enrollment Manager is an application originally developed for ASU which synchronizes enrollment data between the student information system and online learning
    systems such as Blackboard, Sakai and iTunesU.  This application was abstracted to remove ASU-specific code and used to provision courses
    for K-12 institutions under the IDEAL project.
   </div>
   <div class="subsection">
    <span class="subsectionTitle">alt^I Developer VM Environment</span>
    <br/>
    Arizona State University
    <p/>
    Set up a system which provides on-the-fly deployment of virtual machines for developers to
    prototype new applications.  This environment was based on the Xen virtualization system
    and is able to provision a new, fully functional Linux environment in less than five minutes.
    The system also supports Windows-based virtual machines on the same physical system.
   </div>
   <div class="subsection">
    <span class="subsectionTitle">Electronic Messaging Menu Application (EMMA)</span>
    <br/>
    Arizona State University 
    <p/>
    Deployed large-scale electronic messaging portal for a user base of about 70,000.  Key features include a J2EE authentication framework in 
    Java using servlets and a PHP-based web mail client based on the free IMP product.  Modified the IMAP client used by PHP to support Kerberos 
    for single sign-on. 
   </div>
   <div class="subsection">
    <span class="subsectionTitle">uPortal development/deployment (myASU)</span>
    <br/>
    Arizona State University <br/>
    <p/> 
    Deployed an instance of the uPortal product (http://www.ja-sig.org), a J2EE portal designed for higher education.  This work included 
    writing an authentication module to support ASU's single sign-on environment, as well as configuring connections to databases, LDAP, etc.  
    This also included writing various channels for the portal in Java, as well as making custom modifications to the portal itself.

   <div>
    <span class="subsectionTitle">Trimble Outdoors</span>
    <br/>
    Trimble Navigation<br/>
    <p/>
    Designed and built a J2ME-based application to run on various mobile devices which allows users to navigate using GPS on a pre-defined trail.  
    The application is targeted towards the outdoor enthusiast and available from various wireless carriers.
   </div>
   <div class="subsection">
    <span class="subsectionTitle">Trimble Outdoors BREW port</span>
    <br/>
    Trimble Navigation<br/>
    <p/>
    Ported the Trimble Outdoors J2ME-based mobile application to Qualcomm BREW environment for use on a wider range of mobile devices. This
    involved taking a Java based application, and porting it to C/C++. A strong emphasis was made on retaining as much of the original 
    organization as possible, to allow developers to switch between the code bases more easily.
