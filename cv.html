   <div class="subsection">
    <span class="subsectionTitle">Find My Train</span>
    <p>
    Developed iOS and Android applications to allow Phoenix light rail users to locate nearest station and see next train arrival time. The application also allows
    users to view a list and map of stations, and view schedule times for all stops for the current day. This application was started at Phoenix Startup
    Weekend in 2012, and took second place. The team then participated in ASU Rapid Startup School and did many customer development interviews with light
    rail riders in order to determine the marketability and optimal set of features for the application.

    <span class="subsectionTitle">ASU Directory</span>
    <br/>
    Arizona State University
    <p/>
    Redesigned the backend systems to bring together student/faculty/staff data from various enterprise systems, including Peoplesoft and legacy data sources.
    Created a high performance synchronization process to provide hourly updates to data, replacing the previous system which ran once a day. Added an Apache Solr Cloud
    environment with an index of data for easier searching from user-facing applications.

    Set up a system which provides on-the-fly deployment of virtual machines for developers to
    prototype new applications.  This environment was based on the Xen virtualization system
    and is able to provision a new, fully functional Linux environment in less than five minutes.
    The system also supports Windows-based virtual machines on the same physical system.
